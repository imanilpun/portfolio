## Todos

As this portfolio is influence by different design aspects, there is certain things left to do:

- Cleanup Code `As we can clear see in 'File Path' CSS and JS folder needs make clean and understandable code lines, so that everyone can understand the linkage between those file to main INDEX file.`
- Comment `To make code understable to other developer 'comment' should be given so that other coder can understand those lines.`
